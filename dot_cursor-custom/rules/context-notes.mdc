# Context Notes

AI agents are encouraged to create markdown files in the `joshhsoj1902-local/context-notes` directory to store useful context for future AI agents.

Update these files regularly. Reference back to theses files regularly.

## Directory Location

The `joshhsoj1902-local/context-notes` directory is located at the root of the repository.

## Usage

1. **Create the directory if it doesn't exist**: If the `joshhsoj1902-local/context-notes` folder doesn't exist, create it before adding notes.

2. **Create a markdown file**: When you discover or create useful context that would help future AI agents, create a markdown file (e.g., `project-structure.md`, `api-endpoints.md`, `common-patterns.md`, or `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`) in this directory.

3. **Document useful context**: Use the markdown file to document:
   - Project structure and organization
   - Important patterns and conventions
   - API endpoints and their usage
   - Configuration details
   - Common gotchas or important considerations
   - Architecture decisions
   - Any other information that would help future AI agents understand the codebase

4. **Maintain and update files**: **It is important that these files are maintained.** Anytime an agent changes the validity of information in these context files, they should update them accordingly. This ensures that the context remains accurate and useful for future AI agents.

## Important Notes

- **Not committed to git**: The `joshhsoj1902-local` directory is excluded from git (via `.gitignore`), so you can freely put anything useful in it without worrying about committing sensitive information or temporary notes.
- **Maintenance is critical**: These files are meant to help future AI agents, so keeping them up-to-date is essential. When you make changes that invalidate information in context files, update those files.
- **Free-form content**: Since these files are not tracked, feel free to include:
  - Code snippets
  - Configuration examples
  - Architecture diagrams (in markdown format)
  - Links to relevant documentation
  - Any other context that would be helpful

## Example

```bash
# Create the directory if needed
mkdir -p /Users/joshbryans/dev/joshhsoj1902/joshhsoj1902-local/context-notes

# Create a context notes file
touch /Users/joshbryans/dev/joshhsoj1902/joshhsoj1902-local/context-notes/project-structure.md
```

Then document useful context in the markdown file. When you later make changes that affect this context, remember to update the file.
