# Debugging Notes

When actively debugging, create a markdown file in the `joshhsoj1902-local/debugging` directory to keep notes about the progress and debugging process.

Update these files regularly. Reference back to theses files regularly.

## Directory Location

The `joshhsoj1902-local/debugging` directory is located at the root of the repository:

## Usage

1. **Create the directory if it doesn't exist**: If the `joshhsoj1902-local/debugging` folder doesn't exist, create it before adding notes.

2. **Create a markdown file**: When actively debugging, create a markdown file (e.g., `debug-session-YYYY-MM-DD.md` or `debug-issue-name.md`) in this directory.

3. **Document your progress**: Use the markdown file to track:
   - What you're debugging
   - Steps you've taken
   - Findings and observations
   - Commands you've run
   - Code snippets or configurations that are relevant
   - Any other useful information for the debugging session

## Important Notes

- **Not committed to git**: The `joshhsoj1902-local` directory is excluded from git (via `.gitignore`), so you can freely put anything useful in it without worrying about committing sensitive information or temporary notes.
- **Free-form content**: Since these files are not tracked, feel free to include:
  - Temporary code snippets
  - Debug output
  - Personal notes
  - Test configurations
  - Any other debugging artifacts

## Example

```bash
# Create the directory if needed
mkdir -p /Users/joshbryans/dev/joshhsoj1902/joshhsoj1902-local/debugging

# Create a debugging notes file
touch /Users/joshbryans/dev/joshhsoj1902/joshhsoj1902-local/debugging/debug-2025-01-20.md
```

Then document your debugging session in the markdown file.
